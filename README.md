# Word-guessing-game
A fun and simple word-guessing game built with Python! The game randomly picks a word, and you have 12 chances to guess it by entering one letter at a time. With each wrong guess, your chances decrease, but if you uncover the word before running out of turns, you win! Great for practicing Python or just having a good time.
